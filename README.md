You've come to the home of the finest Colonial regiment, the 44th Velian Legionnaires!

Founded under the Colonial flag during the 44th War for the Liberation of Mesea from the Caoivan Expansion, we are a multidisciplinary group that mines, refines, produces, delivers, and rains ordnance on the Wardens wherever need may be.

_"WARDENES EUNT DOMUS"_
