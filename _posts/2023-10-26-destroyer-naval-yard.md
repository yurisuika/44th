We've had a long standing friendship with the 501st since War 80, but today we are embarking on a mission to destroy all Wardens!

Together, with the outbreak of War 108 we are founding a joint naval yard to produce the new Conqueror class destroyers for the eastern fleet.

You can find a link to the 501st Discord and our own on the home page.
