Don has done great diplomatic work to establish a fellowship between the various groups settled to the west of Ashtown.

We have worked out a deal with our neighbors DRW and ★EG★; a pipeline will be laid from the oil fields to the south towards our facility, and from the sea a pipeline shall carry lifegiving water to the oil refineries!

This is our first step in drafting a master auxiliary port to the west of Ashtown. We will service trains heading from Origin as well as freighters. The seaport will not have to be clogged up with trains wishing to unload. Instead, they made do it here! If this is successful, we may see a new era in logistical prowess for the Colonials!
