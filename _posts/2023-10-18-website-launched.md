It has been a long time coming, but the website is here! A few weeks ago the domain was registered to simply redirect to the Discord invite, but we now actually have a site up and running.

The [Discord redirect](http://join.44th.cc) is still around to run on the `join` subdomain, but you can also find links to it and the [501st Discord](http://501st.44th.cc) on the Home and About pages.

## A Brief History

While some of us took up arms way back during the Weekly Wars days, the majority of our founding group first fought during the continental-wide conflict of War 44. The Colonial Coalition had not officially established its regiment system at the time, as that was codified with the outbreak of War 71 when the deteriorating weather demanded a strengthened command system. While we had filed a regiment during that war, it was rather quickly dissolved until our members found their way back to the front during War 80, taking the provisional name of the 177th Logistics Division. During War 81, we were renamed to the 44th Velian Legionnaires to better reflect upon our roots.

## The Future

Currently we don't have any extensive use for the site except as a landing page and for the links, but we may use it for events and documenting our feats in the future!
