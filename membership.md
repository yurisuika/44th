introduction: |
  With the 44th, you're not just another rank and file. We all work together in the cause of purging the Wardens from the green lands of Mesea!

  We'll take to any action required to get the job done, be it routing logistics through to rough frontline locations, manning coordinated armor assaults, running artillery barrages, or whatever need be.

  If you are interested in joining the 44th or our sister group the 501st, rendezvous with us on the battlefield or patch into our communications system!
