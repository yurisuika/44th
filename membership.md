We're a group that puts foremost comradery! We're all united in the cause of abolishing the existence of Wardens from the green lands of Mesea.

We'll take to any action required to get the job done, be it routing logistics through to rough frontline locations, manning coordinated armor assaults, running artillery barrages, or whatever need be.

If you're interested in joining our cause, tune in to our Discord channel or send for a courier on the battlefield!
