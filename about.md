You've come to the home of the finest Colonial regiment, the **44th Velian Legionnaires**!

Founded under the Colonial flag during the 44th War for the Liberation of Mesea from the Caoivan Expansion, we are a multidisciplinary group that mines, refines, produces, delivers, and rains ordnance on the Wardens wherever need may be.
