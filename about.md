introduction: |
  While some of us took up arms way back during the Weekly Wars days, the majority of our founding group first fought during the continental-wide conflict of War 44.

  The Colonial Coalition had not officially established its regiment system at the time, as that was codified with the outbreak of War 71 when the deteriorating weather demanded a strengthened command system. At that time, we filed for a regiment, taking the provisional name of the 177th Logistics Division. During War 81 we were renamed to the 44th Velian Legionnaires to better reflect upon our roots.
