## A Brief History

While some of us took up arms way back during the Weekly Wars days, the majority of our founding group first fought during the continental-wide conflict of War 44. The Colonial Coalition had not officially established its regiment system at the time, as that was codified with the outbreak of War 71 when the deteriorating weather demanded a strengthened command system. While we had filed a regiment during that war, it was rather quickly dissolved until our members found their way back to the front during War 80, taking the provisional name of the 177th Logistics Division. During War 81, we were renamed to the 44th Velian Legionnaires to better reflect upon our roots.
